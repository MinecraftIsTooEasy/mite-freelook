# Minecraft is Too Easy Freelook
Freelook aims to overhaul camera functionality in Minecraft is Too Easy. It adds two new features, a zoom and freelook mode. While the default configs are meant to be well balanced, the extensive customizability options offered let you tweak the mod to your own liking. This mod is a port of [btw-freelook](https://github.com/jeffinitup/btw-freelook).
